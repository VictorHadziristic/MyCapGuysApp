# This is the first Android App I've ever made.

## A few things to know...
 1. This is the only surving Android specific code I have to show off.
 2. I recognize how poorly it is written (This was my first foray into Android, and this is from very early on in my programming career. I was 17 and didn't know how to use objects properly)
 3. This app makes very poor use of Object Oriented paradigms, data generated by the app is not persisted by industry standard methods and it's terribly designed from a code standpoint.
 4. But, it works (Client was very happy with it).
 5. I would not do a project in Android ever again, purely because an app of this sort would benefit from being developed in Flutter/Angular Native/React Native.

## Purpose:
An app that would gauge customer satisfaction, as well as customer interest in future products 

### Requirements: 
  1. Make it easy and engaging to use.
  2. Save customer data to a spreadsheet.
  
## Outcome:
The client was very pleased with the outcome of this app: "We've gained an incredible amount of invaluable information"

### What does the app look like?
